Dre Harm

Goal: Create a discord bot that can randomly get a reddit link from a specified subreddit.
Things that I would also like it to do is be able to choose whether it is top of all time or top of monthly.

TODO
- Add command that gets from top of all time
- Add command that gets from top of monthly
- Be able to specify a sub-reddit
- Add a help command
- Figure out how to randomly get a reddit link
- Figure out how to check if there is enough    content on the given subreddit.
